# oop-practice-calculator
In this project I created a simple persistant calculator that takes 3 arguments, a float, a operator, then another float. after, it will return the answer, and even store it using JSON, which is used to keep the data.

This is my second project and my first ever Classes project, one day I'll look back at this and see I've came a very long way. - 9/20/2025
